                                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                                        <p>Annie is a Fuels Technician who needed to do a hazardous fuels reduction project on the Boise National Forest. Annie used <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> to save time in analysis by developing, modeling, comparing, and generating reports on hazardous fuels reduction treatments within a single interface. Below, she walks us step by step, through her treatment development process from start to finish. </p>
                                        <h2>Management Scenario</h2>
                                        <p>My name is Annie and I’m a Fuels Technician on the Idaho City Ranger District, Boise Nat’l Forest, about 30 miles northeast of Boise, Idaho. I’ve found <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> to be a useful tool in planning hazardous fuels reduction projects and want to share with you my process on one such project.</p>
                                        <p>Through observation and based on Forest Plan direction, I know we need some sort of fuels reduction treatment in the mixed conifer stands in Granite Creek drainage, approximately 4 miles east of Idaho City. The area hasn’t been treated in decades and the understory and surface fuels could contribute to uncharacteristically intense fire behavior. This would not only pose a hazard to the community of Idaho City and adjacent private land, but also cause undue mortality in this fire-adapted low elevation Ponderosa pine ecosystem that thrives on frequent but low severity fires.</p>
                                        <p>My objectives are to:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li value="1"> Reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity to reduce the fire hazard to adjacent private land and the community of Idaho City</li>
                                            <li value="2">Return low intensity fire to fire adapted vegetation communities. </li>
                                            <li value="3">Locate areas where our actions will be most effective</li>
                                            <li value="4"> Evaluate what type of treatment will help me achieve these objectives</li>
                                            <li value="5">Demonstrate the need for treatment, both quantitatively and spatially, to members of our district interdisciplinary (ID) team. </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>I turned to <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> for help with this.</p>

I complete further analysis by repeating this process in the northern part of my landscape where there appears to be several areas that would produce more intense fire behavior. I also compare other aspects of fire behavior, such as Rate of Spread and Crown Fire Activity.</p>

                                        <p>Now that I’ve thoroughly reviewed the map to assess my landscape, modeled fire behavior, and areas for treatment, I want to look at the corresponding landscape and fire behavior summary reports. </p>

                                            <li value="2">Because the Landscape was assigned to the Granite Creek Fuels folder when I&#160;first created it, the model output and Summary Reports are all stored there too by default. I select my "Granite Creek Treatments Folder" in the panel on the left of the screen.

                                        <p>All of the Landscape characteristics and Fire Behavior outputs I viewed in Map Studio are quantitatively displayed in several different formats in this report. I find a lot of value in these reports because they break each component (Canopy Cover, Canopy Base Height, Rate of Spread, etc.) down in a way that makes it even easier, after viewing the spatial data, to assess the landscape and 97th percentile modeled fire behavior. For example, in viewing the Fuel Model map (upper left corner), I can see that I have a lot of Fuel Model TL8 on my landscape, but it’s not until I take a look at the graphs that I can really assess that, in fact, 35% of this landscape is attributed to the TL8 fuel model.</p>
                                        <p>I take a good look at the report in it’s entirety, including the Flame length outputs:</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../../resources/images/granite_crk_dta/report_flame_length_593x418.png" alt="reports include flame length and other fire behavior measurements" style="width: 593;height: 418;" class="border" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>These graphs indicate that, given 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture conditions, a little over half of this landscape will experience Flame Lengths of &gt;0 - .3 meters, while another 1/3rd will experience Flame Lengths &gt;.3 - 1.2 meters. I plan to focus my treatments in the specific areas on this landscape where I’m noticing more intense, “problem” fire behavior, from both an ecological and a control perspective.</p>
                                        <p>

                                        <p>I notice the Auto97th Fire Behavior section of the report has recorded the 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture inputs used to run the fire behavior model. I want to use these values when I re-run the fire behavior model a little later, so I scroll up to the top of the report, look to the top right, and click the <span class="UIcomponent">Download</span><img src="../../resources/images/buttons_general/download_25x18.png" alt="download" style="width: 25;height: 18;" /> button to save this report as a pdf on my local machine.</p>

                                        <p>Now that I have my baseline Landscape and Fire Behavior data, and some specific areas within my landscape for which I’d like to propose treatments to meet my preliminary objectives, I’ll move on to the Develop Treatment Alternatives workflow, under the <span class="UIcomponent">Strategic Planning</span> stage of the <span class="UIcomponent">Cycle</span>. This will allow me to develop and compare fuels treatment alternatives so I can determine how changes in the fuels characteristics affect fire behavior outputs.</p>
                                        <p>I select the <span class="UIcomponent">Develop Treatment Alternatives</span> task.</p>

                                        <p>I notice the Right Hand Panel has some good information regarding how to use my landscapes correctly in this task. I make it a point to read through these panels for each page, they contain really helpful information.</p>
                                        <h3>Edit the landscape to simulate treatment scenarios</h3>
                                        <p>Next, I move to the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span> tab, where I'll select a Default Fuels Treatment rule, and apply it to the landscape to simulate a thin and pile burn. Then I can see what effect the proposed treatment has on my Area of Interest. To do this I:</p>

                                        </p>
                                        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                                            <li value="1">Double check that "Granite Creek LF2012 unedited" landscape is selected</li>
                                            <li value="2">Select the "Thin: Slash Removed default" rule</li>
                                            <li value="3">Choose the "Light Thinning:&#160;Pile Burning" option</li>

                                        <p>This rule will mimic thinning my Area of Interest to about 80% present density by removing understory up to 8” DBH, with subsequent pile burning of thinned material. This information appears if I&#160;hover over the "Light Thinning: Pile Burning" option described in step C above. Alternatively, the description of each default rule can be read in the <a href="../../30-tasks/lndscpedit/treatmentrulebackground.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Editing - Default Fuel Treatment and Disturbance Topic</a> of Help Center.</p>
                                        <p>I’d also like to mimic a broadcast burn after these first entries, but I'll apply that edit in a subsequent edit session. While I&#160;could create a second rule that would be applied after the first ( See the <a href="../../30-tasks/lndscpedit/ruleordering.htm" target="_blank">Rule Ordering Consideration help topic</a> for more details on these), I will apply one at a time so its easier to track the results of the rule on my landscape.  It’s always a good idea to assess your landscape after editing to ensure it’s been applied correctly and makes sense.</p>

With a glance I can see that all the dark blue showing on those West/Northwest facing slopes that had initially shown very high flame lengths, are now indicating significantly decreased flame lengths and fire intensity. </p>

                                        <p>I review the pre- and post-treatment results for each landscape characteristic. These reports have the same quantitative components as the reports I viewed earlier, but they compare the change in acreages in my specified treatment area, or mask, before and after the treatment I selected was applied.</p>
                                        <p>In the bar graph, I can see that green corresponds to pre-treatment fuel models in the treatment area, while blue corresponds to post-treatment. It appears that most of the TL8 acres were changed to TL6 post-treatment. Looking at the tabular data below, I can see that in fact, 54% of the treatment area has changed to Fuel Model TL6 with this treatment.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../../resources/images/granite_crk_dta/dta_comparereport1_fuelmodelcharts_1271x528.png" alt="fuel models are compared via change chart and pie chart" class="border" style="width: 1271;height: 528;" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The Fuel Model Percent Difference graph and pie charts tell the same story. I’m really curious how this translates to expected post-treatment fire behavior. I know that the TL6 Fuel Model has a slightly lower Rate of Spread than the TL8 Fuel Model, but it’d be helpful to quantify and display this.</p>
                                        <p>Next, I go to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> and navigate to my Fire Behavior (Model) Compare Report, "GC12_Lt_Thn_PileRx_1yr/Granite Creek LF2012 unedited - compare model...", and click <span class="UIcomponent">View Report</span>.</p>

                                        <p>As in the landscape Compare Report, green correlates to pre-treatment, while blue indicates post-treatment results in the bar chart. I can see from this bar chart that the number of acres in the lower Flame Length bins goes up post-treatment, while the number in the higher Flame Length bins goes down, indicating a decrease in higher Flame Length post-treatment. The table to the right quantitatively supports this, clearly showing the acres shifting toward the lower flame length bins, post-treatment.</p>
                                        <p>

                                        <p>The Percent Difference Graph for Flame Lengths demonstrates the shift toward lower Flame Lengths post-treatment. I can see the positive percent difference in the &gt;.3 m bin, while the bins correlating to higher Flame Lengths indicate a drop in the percent difference.</p>
                                        <p>The Pie Charts tell the same story, plainly showing the smaller sections of red/orange/yellow in the post-treatment chart.</p>
                                        <p>I scroll through the rest of the Fire Behavior Compare Summary Report to view the rest of fire behavior characteristics. </p>

                                        <p>I’d like to see the effects of applying a subsequent broadcast burn after the light thinning/pile burning. One of my objectives is to re-introduce low intensity fire in this area and I feel it’s an important step in treating this landscape. Additionally, I’d like to see how this additional treatment will affect modeled fire behavior. </p>

                                            <img src="../../resources/images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_flamelength1_681x416.png" alt="table and bar chart of flame length comparison" style="width: 681;height: 416;" class="border" />

                                        <p>The Fire Behavior Compare Reports for a modeled Light Thin/Pile Burn/Low Severity Broadcast Burn treatment show even more of a difference in pre and post-treatment fire behavior.</p>
                                        <p>From the Flame Length Bar Chart, I can see a large increase in the post-treatment acreage for lower Flame Length bins and no post-treatment acres in the higher Flame Length bins.</p>
                                        <p>The table indicates the pre-treatment percentage of pixels in the &gt;0-.3m Flame Length bin is 1%, while post-treatment the percentage went up to 17%. Conversely, the percentage of post-treatment pixels in the 3 highest Flame Length bins is 0, indicating a significant decrease in Flame Lengths post-treatment, across the treatment area.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../../resources/images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_flamelength2_567x318.png" alt="difference chart and pie chart of flame length comparisons" style="width: 567;height: 318;" class="border" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The Percent Difference Graph for Flame Lengths demonstrates the shift toward lower Flame Lengths post-treatment. I can see the significant positive percent difference in the &gt;0 meter bin, while the bins correlating to higher Flame Lengths indicate a drop in the percent difference.</p>
                                        <p>The Pie Charts tell the same story, plainly showing the shift to significantly lower flame lengths in the post-treatment chart.</p>
                                        <p>I scroll through the rest of the fire behavior model outputs in the report. Their story is the same, significantly reduced Rates of Spread, as well as almost no Crown Fire Activity post-treatment.</p>
                                        <p>Next, I navigate back to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> and open the Landscape Compare Summary Report.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../../resources/images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_fuelmodelcompare1_761x558.png" alt="fuel model bar chart and table comparison" style="width: 761;height: 558;" class="border" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The Landscape Compare Reports for a modeled Light Thin/Pile Burn/Low Severity Broadcast Burn treatment show quite a change in Fuel Model pre- vs. post-treatment.</p>
                                        <p>From the compare bar graph, I can tell that a significant portion of the TL8 Fuel Model (Long-Needle Litter) has shifted to the GR2 (Low Load, Dry Climate Grass) and GS1 (Low Load, Dry Climate Grass-Shrub) Fuel Models, 1 year post-treatment. The table to the right confirms this quantitatively, indicating that 52% of the treatment area was comprised of a TL8 Fuel Model pre-treatment, while just 1% of the treatment area was a TL8 Fuel Model post-treatment. Conversely, none of the treatment area contained the GS1 Fuel Model pre-treatment, while post-treatment over 50% of the treatment area was comprised of Fuel Model GS1.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../../resources/images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_fuelmodelcompare2_756x537.png" alt="fuel model change chart and pie chart comparison" style="width: 756;height: 537;" class="border" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The Percent Difference chart reflects the shift in Fuel Model displayed by the Bar Graph and table above, clearly showing the drop in the TL8 Fuel Model, as well as the increase in the GS1 Fuel Model post-treatment.</p>
                                        <p>The Pie Charts visually display these changes in Fuel Model as well.</p>
                                        <p>I review the rest of the Landscape Compare Summary Report and note the changes in the various landscape characteristics. I particularly note the increase in Canopy Base Height, as well as the decrease in Canopy Cover, post-treatment. This coincides with the information I’m seeing in the rest of the report, and reiterates the fact that this series of treatments will help me achieve my stated objectives, which were to: reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity in order to reduce the fire hazard to adjacent private land and the community of Idaho City; and return low intensity fire to fire adapted vegetation communities.</p>

                                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                        <p>I could continue this process and model a more invasive treatment, such as heavier thinning or increased mortality from a more severe broadcast (prescribed) burn, but decide these results will achieve my initial preliminary objectives, and are a good place to start with my project proposal for the District ID Team.</p>
                                        <p>From this process, It’s clear that the expected fire behavior, given 97th percentile fire weather and fuel moisture conditions, in the identified treatment areas is much more intense than what would be considered characteristic in this frequent, but low intensity, fire regime. The reports and maps will demonstrate how these proposed treatments will help achieve the preliminary objectives to reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity, as well as helping to return low intensity fire in these treatment areas.</p>
