                                            <h1 class="Heading1">Editing Landscape Data for Landscape Evaluation</h1>
                                            <p>Landscape Editing can occur in both the Landscape Evaluation stage of the Planning Cycle under&#160;Landscape Edit, or within the Strategic Planning stage under Develop&#160;Treatment Alternatives. Menu options and results are the same for both. The first option is used for making landscape edits, regardless of other activities you are performing in IFTDSS. The second option is built into a larger workflow of creating and comparing treatment alternatives, that we will look at for the final tutorial in this workshop.</p>
                                            <p>Editing in IFTDSS creates a new, edited, version of the landscape you select. This allows you to create different conditions or scenarios with your editing, while never overwriting your original landscape file.&#160; </p>
                                            <p style="background-color: #add8e6;">Tutorial Information: This tutorial includes edits that alter specific parts of our example Haypress landscape. You may follow along with your own landscape, though you may have to select different landscape features to make edits to.&#160; Note that this is the last short tutorial, and not directly linked to activities later in the workshop. As such, feel free to experiment with these editing rules if you like.</p>
                                            <h2 class="Heading2">Editing Rule Background</h2>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li value="1">There are two editing methods in IFTDSS:</li>
                                                <li value="2">Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rules allow you to represent landscape changes based on default editing rules. </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>User Created Edit Rules allow you to directly select and change landscape features. </p>
                                            <p>IFTDSS allows you to either edit your landscape with a single rule, or string together different rules before applying them to your landscape. The online Help Center contains more technical documentation on how rules are implemented, but we will outline a few general rules of thumb here:</p>
                                            <h3 class="Heading3">Applying Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rules</h3>
                                            <p>Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Rules are applied based on the order in which you add them to your editing session. If multiple Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Rules are used within one editing session, they are applied sequentially, meaning that the output from Rule 1 is the input for Rule 2, etc.<br /></p>
                                            <h3 class="Heading3">Applying User Created Edit Rules</h3>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li value="1">A specific attribute for a given cell can only be changed once per editing session. It is the first edit of an attribute for a cell that affects the change. Subsequent rules that prescribe changes to a cell that has already been changed by a previous rule in the same editing session are ignored.</li>
                                                <li value="2">Attributes are considered separately when applying User Created Edit rules. For example, a rule that modifies fuel model for a particular cell does not preclude canopy cover or another fuel attribute from being modified by a subsequent rule.<br /></li>
                                                <li value="3">When applying multiple User Created Edit Rules, the selection criteria cannot be contingent on another change that is being made in the same editing session.<br /></li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <h2>Add Default Fuels Treatment/Disturbance Rule</h2>
                                            <p>Before beginning, we’ll provide a brief explanation on how the Default Fuel Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rules function. These rules are applied using LANDFIRE Lookup tables (LFLU) and Fuel Model Lookup (FMLU) tables. These are applied within IFTDSS, as a user you will not see this process. The LFLU tables were created in an effort to improve the LANDFIRE fuels layers between versions. The LFLU tables are used to adjust the fuel attributes of cells, including fuel model, canopy cover, stand height, canopy base height, and canopy bulk density, based on the type and intensity of treatment or disturbance and the time that has elapsed since that treatment or disturbance. For the full technical details on these rules, visit the&#160;<a href="https://iftdss.firenet.gov/firenetHelp/help/pageHelp/content/30-tasks/lndscpedit/landscapeedittechtopic.htm">Default Edit Rule Technical Documentation Topic</a>.</p>

There is a “1” displayed under order. The “1” indicates this rule will be the first to be applied to the landscape.
