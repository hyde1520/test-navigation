                                        <p>LANDFIRE landscape data are designed to be a course scale satellite-derived national dataset. Due to recent disturbance mechanisms such as fire, windthrow, beetle, drought and disease outbreak, as well as management activities, LANDFIRE data may not reflect well the actual fuel conditions in your project area. Consequently, LANDFIRE data may need to be edited to better reflect the local conditions within your project area, principally to reflect anticipated fire behavior. Additionally, as fuel treatments are simulated LANDFIRE data will need to be edited to reflect post-treatment conditions. Editing a LANDFIRE data set is much easier and faster than developing a landscape data file from scratch.</p>
                                        <p>This tutorial will walk through the process of editing landscape data created in <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> with User Created Edit Rules. It assumes you are already familiar with generating a landscape in <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span>. If needed, you may take a few minutes to become familiar with that process by visiting the <a href="shorts/startandcreatelcp.htm" target="_blank">short landscape creation tutorial.</a></p>
                                        <p>Part One of the tutorial will walk through a basic edit to familiarize you with the editing interface. Part Two of this tutorial will walk through a more complex edit in a way that allows you to generate a summary report of the editing changes. </p>
                                        <div class="notificationTip">
                                            <p>A note on naming landscapes:&#160;It is best practice to keep your landscape name to 30 characters or less, as some tasks in <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> will create default output names that can become quite long. It is also wise to include details in you landscape name to help describe what the landscape is or how it is edited. For example, ending a landscape created from LANDFIRE 2014 data with "LF14" to indicate its origin. </p>

                                        <p>Before beginning editing, you will generate a landscape. Go to the <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> <span class="UIcomponent">Planning Cycle</span>,<span class="UIcomponent"> Landscape Evaluation</span> stage, and the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> task. Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Create landscape</span> button to create the  landscape we'll use in the example using the information below:</p>

                                        <p>You're going to make a simple edit  to simulate a prolonged drought. You’re going to change the GR2 (low load, dry climate grass) to a GR1, which is a short, sparse, dry climate grass.</p>
                                        <p>To begin editing a landscape, you may either find the landscape file in <span class="UIcomponent">MyWorkspace</span> and click <span class="UIcomponent">Edit</span>, or use the <span class="UIcomponent">Planning Cycle</span>, and navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation</span> and then <span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span>.

                                        <p>Now that you have completed an easy edit you will practice with a more complex edit using some different methods. In this scenario you'll examine a specific area, the Cruches Basin Wilderness. You'll make edits within the wilderness area to reflect aspen stands, represented by fuel model TU1(161), that have recently experienced high mortality on dry south-facing slopes. These southerly aspect stands now have many jackstrawed dead down logs  dry enough to burn.</p>
                                        <p>The editing will take place within the Develop Treatment Alternatives (DTA) task. In this case you are not creating treatment alternatives, but will take advantage of DTA's comparison report feature, to generate and view a summary of the fuel changes that result from the edits. If you would like a full tutorial specifically on developing treatment alternatives, we recommend the <a href="nwest_dta/0_introduction.htm" target="_blank">Granite Creek DTA tutorial</a>. </p>

You may consider modifying canopy bulk density as well, but this is at low value already, and we are not concerned that live aspen crowns will burn.

                                        <h3>Reviewing the Landscape Compare Summary Report</h3>
                                        <p>This report compares the two landscapes side by side. From the first graph, you can see fuel model TL4 is present on your edited landscape but not on the original landscape. </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../resources/images/tutorial_editing_userr/report_fm_bar.png" alt="TL4 is visible on the newly edited landscape." class="border" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Scrolling down to the Percent Difference chart, you will also see that TL4 has increased by approximately 6%, and TU1 had decreased by the same. This confirms that your edits moved some of the TU1 to TL4. The other tables and charts confirm this as you scroll down further. </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../resources/images/tutorial_editing_userr/report_fm_difference.png" alt="difference chart showing a shift from TU1 to TL1" class="border" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Review the charts and tables for Canopy Cover. Do these reflect the edits you made to the canopy cover? </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../resources/images/tutorial_editing_userr/report_cc_difference.png" alt="canopy cover difference chart showing changes in canopy cover" class="border" />

                                        <p>This report is very powerful. Individual sections can be exported in various formats using the button in the top right, as shown below, and entire reports may be downloaded using the download <img src="../resources/images/buttons_general/download_16x12.png" alt="download" class="iftbutton" style="width: 16;height: 12;" /> button in the top right of the PDF. </p>

                                        <p>Additionally, data displayed in tables can be exported in CSV, Excel, or PDF format or copied for written reports or printed, and data can be exported in CSV or Excel format for further analysis or display with other graphs or tables.&#160; </p>

                                        <h3>Another Look</h3>
                                        <p> Return to the Comparison tab summary reports option. This time, generate a report for fire behavior comparison and review it. </p>
                                        <p>What changes did your edit rule make to the fire behavior on the landscape? Does this make sense changing from a grass-shrub model to logs over a small portion of the landscape?</p>
                                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                        <p>This concludes the  User Created Edit Rules tutorial, but feel free to explore and use your new skills to try other landscape edits. <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> also has default fuel treatment and disturbance based edit rules that can be used to edit your landscape.
