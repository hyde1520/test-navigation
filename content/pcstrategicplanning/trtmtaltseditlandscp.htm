                                        <p>Landscape Editing can occur in both the Landscape Evaluation stage of the Planning Cycle under<span class="UIcomponent"> Landscape Edit</span>, or within the Strategic Planning stage under Develop <span class="UIcomponent">Treatment Alternatives</span>. Menu options and results are the same for both. In editing sessions accessed from the Landscape Evaluation Section, any landscape can be edited. In editing sessions accessed from  the Develop Treatment Alternatives section only certain landscapes may be selected to ensure the comparison between landscapes of the same extent.</p>
                                        <p>In Developing Treatment Alternatives, your <a href="../concepts/aboutlandscapesiniftdss.htm#Originating_Landscape_(Zero_“0”_landscape)" target="_blank">Originating Landscape</a> must be an <a href="../concepts/aboutlandscapesiniftdss.htm#Extracted_Unedited_Landscape" target="_blank">Extracted, unedited LANDFIRE</a> landscape and the only landscapes available for you to edit must fall within the same landscape extent. </p>
                                        <div class="notificationImportant">
                                            <p><strong>Important!</strong> Be deliberate in the rules you apply when editing landscapes:</p>
                                            <p>Rules are applied based on the order in which you add them. Default Treatment/Disturbance rules are always applied <span class="Emphasis">first</span>, in the order you have assigned them, followed by followed by User Created Edit rules in the order you have assigned them.</p>
                                            <p>After applying rules to a given landscape you should always validate that your changes have been made as you intended. <span class="Emphasis">If you are unsure of the effect of the rules you apply, consider saving a version of your landscape after each edit to allow for easy comparison of the changes made by each edit rule you apply</span>.</p>

                                                <p>Default Fuel Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rules use previously existing LANDFIRE Lookup tables (LFLU) and Fuel Model Lookup (FMLU) tables. The LFLU tables were created in an effort to improve the LANDFIRE fuels layers between versions. The LFLU tables are used to adjust the fuel attributes of cells, including fuel model, canopy cover, stand height, canopy base height, and canopy bulk density, based on the type and intensity of treatment or disturbance and the time that has elapsed since that treatment or disturbance. For more technical details on these rules, visit the <a href="../pclandscapeeval/landscapeedittechtopic.htm" target="_blank">Default Edit Rule Technical Documentation Topic</a>.</p>

                                                <p>Here you will edit landscapes to develop your Existing Condition (EC) if needed, and your treatment alternatives. The only landscape(s) available to edit at this point will be landscape “0” and any landscapes matching that extent. Create your alternatives by altering your Existing Condition landscape, whether that’s the "0" landscape, an existing landscape that has been made available in this step, or one that you create in this editing step from landscape "0". Whatever the case might be, it is very important to have an Existing Condition to ensure more accurate comparison results to gauge how each alternative does or does not meet objectives. The Existing Condition may need to reflect new disturbances on your landscape, like recent wildfires, fuels treatments, or windfalls.</p>
                                                <p>The first step in applying a Default Fuel Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rule is to specify the Treatment or Disturbance Type, and when prompted, select intensity or severity of the fuel treatment or disturbance type.</p>
                                                <p>Next you will choose the Time Since Treatment or Disturbance that is most appropriate.</p>
                                                <p>Lastly you will decide on the extent to which you will apply the rule. If you choose a Landscape Mask, it allows you limit the application of the rule to only the area within the chosen mask. If Landscape Mask is left blank rule will be applied to the entire landscape.</p>
                                                <h2>Landscape Edit Rules</h2>

                                                <p><b>Clearcut and Broadcast Burn</b> - This treatment consists of removal of 100% of overstory with subsequent prescribed burn covering 100% of the area.</p>
