                                        <p>Developing Treatment Alternatives facilitates evaluation of fuel treatment alternatives and their spatial arrangement on the landscape. It allows you to create several edited versions of a landscape or treatment area, run a fire behavior simulation for some or all of the edited landscapes, and compare the results for each treatment on fire behavior spatially, and create reports with charts and tables if desired. The task is divided into five steps:</p>

The landscape chosen or created in this step initiates your comparison session and will be marked with “0” throughout the workflow.  The “0” indicates the original landscape extracted from LANDFIRE that has not been edited. In subsequent tabs, all landscapes that match this extent will be available for you to work with. In the next tab, the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span> tab, you may edit any of these landscapes. You may use the area of Interest field to constrain your analysis to a specific area within the landscape.</p>

For example, if we are interested in the change in flame length between a Treatment and the Existing landscape, we'd select the Treatment first (it gets assigned "1") and the Existing condition landscape second (it gets assigned "2"). <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> calculates landscape change as:</p>

                                                    <p>3ft-8ft = -5 ft.</p>
