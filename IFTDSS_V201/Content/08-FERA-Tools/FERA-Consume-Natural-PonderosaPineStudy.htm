        <p>A total of 60 units were burned in ponderosa-pine–dominated forests in Arizona, eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington. Sites were confined to slopes &lt; 70 percent and where fuels were relatively homogeneous across a burn unit. Sampled stands were generally unmanaged, but nine were thinned prior to burning and contained some logging <span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">slash<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">The coarse and fine woody debris generated by natural processes (such as wind) or by logging operations.</span></span>.</p>
        <h2>Sampling Methods</h2>

A typical sampling layout included fifty-four 20-m to 30-m long transects originating from 18 systematically located sample points. In addition, 20 to 40 logs were randomly selected for large <span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">woody fuel<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">Woody fuels have a true woody stem. Woody fuels include sound wood, rotten wood, and stumps.</span></span> reduction measurements in each burn unit. A labeled wire was wrapped tightly around each log during pre-burn sampling, and then cinched tightly following the burn to measure diameter reduction. Small fuels (&lt; 7.6 cm in diameter) were measured before and after the burn using planar intersects originating from the same 18 systematically located sample points.</p>
        <p>Litter and duff consumption were measured as depth reduction using steel nails inserted into the forest floor prior to the burn. Within 2 m of each of the 18 sample points, 16 nails were inserted into the forest floor until they were embedded in mineral soil and the nail head was flush with the forest floor surface. Litter depth around each nail was measured prior to the burn.</p>
        <p>Following the burn, nails were found again, and the depth of the exposed nail and the depth to mineral soil were measured. Litter depth reduction was calculated by subtracting the depth of the exposed nail from the preburn litter depth. Preburn duff depth was calculated by subtracting litter depth from the depth to mineral soil, and duff reduction was calculated as the remainder of the depth of the exposed nail and litter depth if the depth of the exposed nail was greater than litter depth. A known volume of litter and duff was sampled and oven dried to calculate sample bulk densities (g cm<sup>-3</sup>). Pre-burn depths and post-burn reduction were multiplied by the mean bulk density values to calculate litter and duff loadings and mass consumed.</p>
        <p>On the day of the burn, <span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">fuel moisture<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">Moisture content in fuels determines whether and to what extent fuels will burn.

Each wired log was sampled by sawing disks from near the small and large end of each log. Fuel moisture was recorded as the average of the two disks. Grab samples of 10-hr (0.6 to 2.5 cm diameter) and 100-hr (2.5 to 7.6 cm diameter) downed wood (10 to 30 pieces per sample) were collected from throughout the burn unit, and samples of litter and duff were collected near each sample point to characterize the small woody fuels and forest floor, respectively.</p>
