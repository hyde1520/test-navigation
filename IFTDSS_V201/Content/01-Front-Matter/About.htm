Hundreds of standalone software systems, each with unique user interfaces, require a substantial amount of time to learn. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on data transformations among models is often greater than the amount of time spent on analysis.</p>
        <p>  IFTDSS is a result of the Software Tools and Systems study conducted by the JFSP to look into these issues.

        <h2><a name="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h2>
        <p>Because IFTDSS provides a single portal for access to several sources of data and models for fuels treatment planning, it conveys a number of benefits and solutions. Some of the highlights of IFTDSS are that it</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li value="1">reduces or eliminates the amount of time a user needs to spend learning new interfaces and transforming data.</li>
            <li value="2">provides workflows that organize the business needs of fuels treatment planners.</li>
            <li value="3">makes it easy for planners to efficiently reuse and share their work products.</li>
            <li value="4">provides a consistent analysis framework for all users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Current"></a>Status</h2>
        <p>As of October 2012, the current version of IFTDSS is version 2.0. This version is available for testing and evaluation by members of the various cooperating stakeholder groups.</p>
        <p>Extensive guidance by a broad range of fuels treatment specialists over the last three years has resulted in the identification of five critically important <span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">workflow<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">A set of modeling pathways that provide access to fuels treatment analysis and planning tools in a stepwise and intuitive manner.

        <h2><a name="Stakehol"></a>Stakeholders</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor700"></a>Many individuals have contributed to the IFTDSS software development effort. We greatly appreciate the support and guidance provided by John Cissel, the JFSP program manager. Erik Christiansen, Chair of the Fuels Management Committee (FMC), provided key help and support for analyzing the fuels treatment process that is a struggle for specialists from all agencies. The JFSP Fuels Treatment Working Group (FTWG)—Michael Beasely, Dennis Dupuis, Mark Finney, Glen Gibson, Randi Jandt, David Peterson, Tessa Nicolet, and Brad Reed—has guided our work and provided initial critique and innovative ideas for the project. The JFSP Software Tools and Systems Study Advisory Committee—Pat Andrews, Nate Benson, Mike Hilbruner, Mike Hutt, David Peterson, Carol Saras, Paul Schlobohm, Shari Shetler, and Tim Swedberg—has kept the study headed in the right direction and made sure that all of the various components of a successful solution were considered.</p>
        <p>We would like to specifically acknowledge the fuels treatment specialists who have agreed to participate in this effort to serve as the IFTDSS proof of concept (POC) Test User Group—Brad Reed, Brenda Wilmore, Eric Miller, Gary Curcio, Gary Fildes, Gwen Lipp, Jim Roessler, Jon Wallace, Jonathan Olsen, Karen Folger, Mack McFarland, Nikia Hernandez, Perry Grissom, Randi Jandt, Randy Stiplin, Scott Weyenberg, Sean McEldery, Tessa Nicolet, Alison Forrestel, Brian Sorbel, Daniel Rasmussen, Dennis Fiore, Dennis Page, Glenn Gibson, Jeremy Spetter, Joshua Keown, Kim Kelly, Kyle Jacobson, Loretta Duke, Mike Uebel, Sam Amato, Anna Payne, Dave Pergolski, Jennifer Croft, Jeremy Bennet, John Washington, Ken Rodgers, Mathew Weldon, Paul Maday, Rance Marquez, Albert Savage, William Aney, Yanu Gallimore, Lauren Miller, and Kristen Allison—who have provided, and will continue to provide, valuable feedback regarding the functionality and usability of the IFTDSS. We also thank the broader group of 49 field fuels treatment specialists who helped develop and refine the fuels treatment decision support process.</p>
        <p>We would like to express our appreciation of the fire and fuels science and software development community—Eric Twombly, Mark Finney, Joe Scott, Alan Ager, Nick Crookston, Larry Gangi, Woodham Chung, Kurt Kruger—for their cooperation and feedback related to integrating data and software applications that will be a part of the IFTDSS.

All of these groups constitute the stakeholders whose jobs will be positively affected by the results of this project. It will take long-term attention and energy from these groups of stakeholders, and from others yet to be engaged, to create an effective community of interest that will ensure that the IFTDSS helps all of us do our jobs better.</p>
