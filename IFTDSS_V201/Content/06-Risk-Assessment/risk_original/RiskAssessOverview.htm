IFTDSS provides two approaches for assessing fire hazard and risk across the landscape based on the methods described in the RMRS-GTR-235 <em>Wildfire Risk and Hazard: Procedures for the First Approximation</em> (Calkin et. al., <a href="../../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Calkinetal2010a">2010a</a>).</p>
        <p>The processes proposed by Calkin et al. (2010a) and modified for use in IFTDSS are designed to develop a strategic-level, first approximation of how fire likelihood and fire behavior potentials across landscapes influence risk to social, economic, and ecological values within an <span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">area of interest<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">For IFTDSS, an area of interest (<span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">AOI<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">For IFTDSS, an area of interest (AOI) is a scale-independent unit of area defined by a user.

        <p>We choose the Calkin et al. (2010a) approach that incorporates risk assessment research by Mark Finney and Alan Ager for our first set of risk assessment modules for several reasons.  First, the Calkin et al. (2010a) approach uses the best developed quantitative procedures for assigning risk across landscapes in a fire management context.  Next, these procedures use tools and functionality currently implemented in the IFTDSS.  Finally, we felt that the Calkin et al. (2010a) approach provides easy-to-understand quantitative measures of the hazards of burning, while also including quantitative metrics for evaluating potential ecological benefits of fire on the landscape. Additional risk assessment strategies will be implemented as IFTDSS development continues.</p>
        <p>The results from the risk assessment tools in IFTDSS can provide information useful for evaluating and prioritizing where to place fuel treatments to reduce fire hazard and risk to valued resources.</p>

        <p>This method uses the response functions developed by Calkin et. al.

        <h3><a name="kanchor984"></a>Risk Assessment by Flame Length Probabilities</h3>
        <p>In this approach, risk is defined as the expected net value change within an area (in this case, an area represented by a 30 x 30 meter pixel) calculated as the product of (1) the probabilities that the area represented by the pixel will burn (using user-defined flame lengths and flame length classes—low, medium, high, and very high) given a random ignition within the project area, and (2) the resulting change in financial or ecological value (response function) if the area represented by the pixel burns for each <span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">user-defined flame length<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">The flame length of a spreading <span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">surface fire<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">A fire that burns only the surface <span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">litter<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; "><span class="MCTextPopup"><a class="MCTextPopupSpot_Popup_0" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;">Litter<img style="border: none;margin-left: 5px;" src="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../../SkinSupport/ExpandingOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCExpandingIcon" /></a><span class="MCTextPopupBody_Popup_0" style="display: none; ">Litter is the leaves, needles, fine twigs (but not branches), and other recognizable organic material (such as leaves and flowers), on the forest or grassland floor that have undergone little or no decomposition.

        <p>This method uses the response functions developed by Calkin et. al. (2010a) and modeled flame length burn probabilities from the <a href="../../10-Reference/RefRAN.htm">IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG burn probability simulator</a> to estimate the likelihood of the area represented by the pixel burning, and the potential consequences if the area represented by the pixel is burned by a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire.</p>
        <p>This approach differs from the worst-case flame length approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits for an area represented by a pixel burning.</p>
        <h3><a name="kanchor985"></a>When This Approach Is Useful</h3>
        <p>This approach is somewhat more sophisticated than the worst-case flame length approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits for an area represented by a pixel burning.</p>
        <p>This approach is useful when the user is interested in identifying the potential consequences of an area represented by a pixel burning under variable fire conditions and/or assessing the potential ecological benefits of using fire as a management tool.</p>
