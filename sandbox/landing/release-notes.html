        <h2>IFTDSS 3.0.0 - Initial Release April 2017</h2>
        <h2>Landscape Evaluation</h2>
        <h3>Landscape Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a Landscape (LANDFIRE 2012) and view in map studio (ArcGIS Online based)</li>
            <li>Generate a Landscape Summary report (summary of 8 LCP layers – aspect, Canopy Base Height, Canopy Bulk Density, Canopy Cover, Elevation, Fuel Model, slope, Stand Height)</li>
            <li>Draw or upload a shapefile to outline an area of interest</li>
            <li>Generate landscape summary report for area of interest (same as above)</li>
            <li>AutoGenerate 97th percentile weather fire behavior run and include in summary report (Flame Length, Spread Rate, Fireline Intensity, Heat per Unit Area, Crown Fire Activity)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Landscape Edit</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit Landscape (change fuel models for entire landscape or using a mask or a separate area) using manual rules or predetermined rules based on LandFire Lookup tables of disturbance (Help content to come)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Landscape Fire Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Run Landscape fire behavior (essentially Basic FlamMap 5.0 - fire behavior outputs per pixel) NO spread models yet (MTT etc) Displays in Map Studio</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Strategic Planning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine how different fuels treatments and their spatial arrangement affect landscape characteristics and fire behavior. Generate maps and reports to compare landscapes and fire behavior model outputs. Use these outcomes/outputs to determine the best fuels management strategy to meet your project objectives<ul><li>Select an originating landscape, edit your landscape as needed either manually or utilizing the Landfire lookup rules. Save new edited landscape</li><li>Enter Fire Behavior Model Inputs</li><li>Run Fire Behavior on selected Landscapes</li><li>Compare landscape changes and fire behavior model output differences</li></ul></li>
