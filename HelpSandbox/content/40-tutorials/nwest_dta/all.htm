                                        <h2>Management Scenario</h2>
                                        <p>You are a Fuels Technician on the Idaho City Ranger District, Boise Nat’l Forest, about 30 miles northeast of Boise, Idaho. In this scenario you will use <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> to plan a hazardous fuels reduction project.</p>
                                        <p>Through observation and based on Forest Plan direction, you see a need for some sort of fuels reduction treatment in the mixed conifer stands in Granite Creek drainage, approximately 4 miles east of Idaho City. The area hasn’t been treated in decades and the understory and surface fuels could contribute to uncharacteristically intense fire behavior. This would not only pose a hazard to the community of Idaho City and adjacent private land, but also cause undue mortality in this fire-adapted low elevation Ponderosa pine ecosystem that thrives on frequent but low severity fires.</p>
                                        <p>Your objectives are to:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li value="1"> Reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity to reduce the fire hazard to adjacent private land and the community of Idaho City</li>
                                            <li value="2">Return low intensity fire to fire adapted vegetation communities. </li>
                                            <li value="3">Locate areas where our actions will be most effective</li>
                                            <li value="4"> Evaluate what type of treatment will help me achieve these objectives</li>
                                            <li value="5">Demonstrate the need for treatment, both quantitatively and spatially, to members of our district interdisciplinary (ID) team. </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>You'll use <span class="GeneralProductName">IFTDSS</span> to plan a treatment around these objectives.</p>
                                        <p>

                                        <p>All of the Landscape characteristics and Fire Behavior outputs you viewed in <span class="GeneralMapStudio">Map Studio</span> are quantitatively displayed in several different formats in this report. You'll find a lot of value in these reports because they break each component (Canopy Cover, Canopy Base Height, Rate of Spread, etc.) down in a way that makes it even easier, after viewing the spatial data, to assess the landscape and 97th percentile modeled fire behavior. For example, in viewing the Fuel Model map (upper left corner), you can see that there is a lot of Fuel Model TL8 on the landscape, but it’s not until you take a look at the graphs that you can really assess that, in fact, 35% of this landscape is attributed to the TL8 fuel model.</p>
                                        <p>Take a good look at the report in it’s entirety, including the Flame length outputs:</p>
                                        <p>

                                        </p>
                                        <p>These graphs indicate that, given 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture conditions, a little over half of this landscape will experience Flame Lengths of &gt;0 - .3 meters, while another 1/3rd will experience Flame Lengths &gt;.3 - 1.2 meters. The specific areas on this landscape where more intense, “problem” fire behavior is seen, is where our treatments are focused.</p>
                                        <p>

                                        <p>Now that you have a baseline Landscape and Fire Behavior data, and some specific areas within the landscape for which you’d like to propose treatments to meet the preliminary objectives, you’ll move on to the Develop Treatment Alternatives workflow, under the <span class="UIcomponent">Strategic Planning</span> stage of the <span class="UIcomponent">Cycle</span>. This will allow you to develop and compare fuels treatment alternatives so you can determine how changes in the fuels characteristics affect fire behavior outputs.</p>
                                        <p>I select the <span class="UIcomponent">Develop Treatment Alternatives</span> task.</p>

                                        <p>This rule will mimic thinning the Area of Interest to about 80% present density by removing understory up to 8” DBH, with subsequent pile burning of thinned material. This information appears if you&#160;hover over the "Light Thinning: Pile Burning" option described in step C above. Alternatively, the description of each default rule can be read in the <a href="../../30-tasks/lndscpedit/treatmentrulebackground.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Editing - Default Fuel Treatment and Disturbance Topic</a> of Help Center.</p>
                                        <p>You'll also like to mimic a broadcast burn after these first entries, but apply that edit in a subsequent edit session. While you&#160;could create a second rule that would be applied after the first ( See the <a href="../../30-tasks/lndscpedit/ruleordering.htm" target="_blank">Rule Ordering Consideration help topic</a> for more details on these), you'll apply one at a time so its easier to track the results of the rule on the landscape.  It’s always a good idea to assess your landscape after editing to ensure it’s been applied correctly and makes sense.</p>

This layer shows the difference between post-treatment and pre-treatment Flame Lengths. With a glance you can see that all the dark blue showing on those West/Northwest facing slopes that had initially shown very high flame lengths, are now indicating significantly decreased flame lengths and fire intensity. </p>

                                        <p>Review the pre- and post-treatment results for each landscape characteristic.

                                        <p>In the bar graph, we can see that green corresponds to pre-treatment fuel models in the treatment area, while blue corresponds to post-treatment. It appears that most of the TL8 acres were changed to TL6 post-treatment. Looking at the tabular data below, we can see that in fact, 54% of the treatment area has changed to Fuel Model TL6 with this treatment.</p>

                                        <p>As in the landscape Compare Report, green correlates to pre-treatment, while blue indicates post-treatment results in the bar chart. You can see from this bar chart that the number of acres in the lower Flame Length bins goes up post-treatment, while the number in the higher Flame Length bins goes down, indicating a decrease in higher Flame Length post-treatment. The table to the right quantitatively supports this, clearly showing the acres shifting toward the lower flame length bins, post-treatment.</p>

                                        <p>The Percent Difference Graph for Flame Lengths demonstrates the shift toward lower Flame Lengths post-treatment. You can see the positive percent difference in the &gt;.3 m bin, while the bins correlating to higher Flame Lengths indicate a drop in the percent difference.</p>
                                        <p>The Pie Charts tell the same story, plainly showing the smaller sections of red/orange/yellow in the post-treatment chart.</p>

                                        <p>Lets look at the effects of applying a subsequent broadcast burn after the light thinning/pile burning. One of our objectives is to re-introduce low intensity fire in this area and  it’s an important step in treating this landscape. Additionally, we can see how this additional treatment will affect modeled fire behavior. </p>

                                        <p>The Fire Behavior Compare Reports for a modeled Light Thin/Pile Burn/Low Severity Broadcast Burn treatment show even more of a difference in pre and post-treatment fire behavior.</p>
                                        <p>The Flame Length Bar Chart shows a large increase in the post-treatment acreage for lower Flame Length bins and no post-treatment acres in the higher Flame Length bins.</p>
                                        <p>The table indicates the pre-treatment percentage of pixels in the &gt;0-.3m Flame Length bin is 1%, while post-treatment the percentage went up to 17%. Conversely, the percentage of post-treatment pixels in the 3 highest Flame Length bins is 0, indicating a significant decrease in Flame Lengths post-treatment, across the treatment area.</p>
                                        <p>

                                        <p>The Percent Difference Graph for Flame Lengths demonstrates the shift toward lower Flame Lengths post-treatment. You can see the significant positive percent difference in the &gt;0 meter bin, while the bins correlating to higher Flame Lengths indicate a drop in the percent difference.</p>
                                        <p>The Pie Charts tell the same story, plainly showing the shift to significantly lower flame lengths in the post-treatment chart.</p>
                                        <p>Scroll through the rest of the fire behavior model outputs in the report. Their story is the same, significantly reduced Rates of Spread, as well as almost no Crown Fire Activity post-treatment.</p>
                                        <p>Next, navigate back to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> and open the Landscape Compare Summary Report.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../../resources/images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_fuelmodelcompare1_630x463.png" alt="fuel model bar chart and table comparison" style="width: 630;height: 463;" class="border" />

                                        <p>The Landscape Compare Reports for a modeled Light Thin/Pile Burn/Low Severity Broadcast Burn treatment show quite a change in Fuel Model pre- vs. post-treatment.</p>
                                        <p>From the compare bar graph, we can tell that a significant portion of the TL8 Fuel Model (Long-Needle Litter) has shifted to the GR2 (Low Load, Dry Climate Grass) and GS1 (Low Load, Dry Climate Grass-Shrub) Fuel Models, 1 year post-treatment. The table to the right confirms this quantitatively, indicating that 52% of the treatment area was comprised of a TL8 Fuel Model pre-treatment, while just 1% of the treatment area was a TL8 Fuel Model post-treatment. Conversely, none of the treatment area contained the GS1 Fuel Model pre-treatment, while post-treatment over 50% of the treatment area was comprised of Fuel Model GS1.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img src="../../resources/images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_fuelmodelcompare2_630x448.png" alt="fuel model change chart and pie chart comparison" style="width: 630;height: 448;" class="border" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The Percent Difference chart reflects the shift in Fuel Model displayed by the Bar Graph and table above, clearly showing the drop in the TL8 Fuel Model, as well as the increase in the GS1 Fuel Model post-treatment.</p>
                                        <p>The Pie Charts visually display these changes in Fuel Model as well.</p>
                                        <p>Review the rest of the Landscape Compare Summary Report and note the changes in the various landscape characteristics. Pay particular attention to the increase in Canopy Base Height, as well as the decrease in Canopy Cover, post-treatment. This coincides with the information we see in the rest of the report, and reiterates the fact that this series of treatments will help achieve the stated objectives, which were to: reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity in order to reduce the fire hazard to adjacent private land and the community of Idaho City; and return low intensity fire to fire adapted vegetation communities.</p>

                                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                        <p>We could continue this process and model a more invasive treatment, such as heavier thinning or increased mortality from a more severe broadcast (prescribed) burn, but  these results will achieve our initial preliminary objectives, and are a good place to start with a project proposal for the District ID Team.</p>
                                        <p>From this process, it’s clear that the expected fire behavior, given 97th percentile fire weather and fuel moisture conditions, in the identified treatment areas is much more intense than what would be considered characteristic in this frequent, but low intensity, fire regime. The reports and maps will demonstrate how these proposed treatments will help achieve the preliminary objectives to reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity, as well as helping to return low intensity fire in these treatment areas.</p>
